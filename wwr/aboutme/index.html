    <p>Hi everyone, I'm Luis, I'm from Spain, right now I'm doing vocational training in computing-related with phone devices, the reason I joined this course was because of my hobbies, and that I'm interested in web programming since it was one of the courses that I wanted to do, but I decided to study it here in BYU and focus on other studies here in Spain.<br></p>
      The person that motivated me to do this course was my dad because I started to learn HTML two years ago, so I wanted to keep that knowledge with me,  it also gave me a lot of opportunities way before so I decided to improve on it, it's a please to meet you all, and I hope we can help each other.</p>
